1: ﻿IT'S A BLUSTERY DAY ALONG A DESOLATE COASTLINE FAR FROM DUCKBURG AS A RURAL POSTMAN MAKES HIS ROUNDS...

1: 在远离鸭堡的荒凉的海边，一位乡村邮递员顶着狂风艰难地前行着……

2: GASP! WHEEZE! I KNOW THIS ROUTE IS MY PUNISHMENT FOR PUTTING ITCHING POWDER ON THE POSTMASTER'S NEW UNIFORM...

2: 呼哧！我知道这趟差事是对我的惩罚，惩罚我在邮政局长的新制服上涂了痒痒粉……

3: ﻿... BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D GET STUCK HIKING ALL THE WAY TO PARIAH POINT. GRUMBLE. WHAT KIND OF LOSER WOULD LIVE IN THAT OLD SHACK?

3: ……但我没想到我需要到这样一个与世隔绝的地方来！呼哧！什么样的窝囊废才会住在那个破屋里?

4: ﻿IT MUST BE SOMEONE IN TOTAL DISGRACE -- LIKE THE POLITICIAN WHO BUILT THE PLACE! GRIPE! AT LEAST HE NEVER GOT ANY MAIL!

4: 肯定是个讨人厌的人——就像建造这个地方的政治家一样！哼！但政治家至少没收到过任何邮件！

5: ﻿ANYONE HOME IN THERE? THIS IS YOUR MAILMAN!

5: ﻿有人在家吗？我是邮递员！

6: ﻿OH, SO? GOT ANY I.D. TO PROVE IT?

6: 真的？
身份证明有吗？

7: ﻿GRRR! DON'T MESS WITH ME, DUCK! I'M IN NO MOOD FOR GAMES!

7: 哼！不要跟我开玩笑了，鸭子！我可没心情陪你玩！

8: ﻿*ULP! SORRY!

1: ﻿OF COURSE NOT, YOU BLUBBERING BIRDBRAIN! WHY WOULD ANYONE SANE COME HERE?!

1: ﻿当然没有，哪个正常人会跑到这里来？！

2: ﻿IN FACT, I'VE BEEN WONDERING ABOUT: YOUR SANITY! IS THIS LETTER FROM YOUR PSYCHIATRIS7?

2: 我怀疑你就不是个正常人！这封信是不是就是你的精神病医生给你的？

3: ﻿HA! HA! VERY FUNNY! BUT I'M NOT CRAZY!..

3: 嘿！我可不是疯子。

4: ﻿... JUST CAUTIOUS! WHEN I TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED TO ME, YOU'LL UNDER STAND WHY!

4: 让我告诉你事情的前因后果，你就会明白我会什么到这里来了!

5: ﻿"IT ALL STARTED AT MY UNCLE'S SOAP FACTORY! I WAS LATE FOR WORK AND HE WAS FURIOUS..."

5: 我在我叔叔的肥皂厂工作。我迟到了，然后我叔叔非常生气……

6: ﻿YOU WORK-SHY LITTLE WORM! HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO LECTURE YOU ABOUT TARDINESS?

6: ﻿你这个不好好工作的懒虫！我要跟你讲多少次不要迟到？

7: ﻿BUT UNCLE SCROOGE! WHAT'S THREE SECONDS？

7: 但是史高治叔叔，我只迟到了3秒钟。

8: ﻿SPUTTER! SECONDS ARE TIME, NEPHEW, AND TIME IS MONEY! THAT'S A FACT YOU CAN MEDITATE ON WHILE YOU UNLOAD THE DRUMS ON THAT TRUCK!

8: 分秒就是时间，时间就是金钱，侄子！去把那些桶从卡车上卸下来，同时思考下我说的对不对！

9: ﻿YUCK! THESE DRUMS ARE FULL OF SOME KIND OF GREEN SLIME!

9: 真恶心！这些桶里装满了某种绿色黏液！

10: ﻿ONLY THAT OLD TIGHTWAD COULD FIND A USE FOR SUCH GARBAGE! HE REALLY KNOWS HOW TO PUNISH A GUY!

10: 只有那个老吝啬鬼才能找到这种垃圾的用处！他可真会惩罚人！

11: ﻿DRAT! I'M GETTING COVERED WITH THE STUFF!

2: ﻿WHAT THE...? DID A CYCLONE PASS THROUGH THE YARDI

2: 这是怎么回事？是起了旋风了吗？

3: ﻿NO, UNCLE SCROOGE! I HAD A LITTLE ... UH... ACCIDENT

3: ﻿不，史高治叔叔！是我出了点小事故……

4: ﻿YOU NUMBSKULL! ONLY YOU COULD MAKE SUCH A HORRENDOUS MESS WHILE STANDING ON THE BACK OF A TRUCK!

4: 你这个笨蛋！也就你才会给我弄得这么乱!

5: ﻿WELL, YOU'LL CLEAN THIS UP BEFORE YOU GO HOME, EVEN IF IT TAKES YOU ALL NIGHT

5: 回家前把这些清理干净，即使花一整晚的时间！

6: ﻿BUT I HAVE A DATE WITH DAISY THIS EVENING! YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO BE TARDY, WOULD YOU?

6: ﻿但我今晚和黛丝有个约会！您一直教我不要迟到，对吧？

7: ﻿WHAT DO I CARE 7 I'M NOT PAYING YOU OVERTIME FOR THIS! I WON'T PAY YOU AT ALL UNLESS THE WHOLE FACTORY'S SPIC AND SPAN!

7: 我在乎的是什么？我不会付你加班费的！除非整个工厂都干干净净，我一分钱都不会给你!

8: ﻿BUT.. BUT... BUT...

8: 但……
但是……

9: ﻿STOP STUTTERING AND GET TO WORK! WE'RE BEING INSPECTED TOMORROW AND I WANT THIS PLACE IN TIP-TOP SHAPE!

9: 别支支吾吾了，快干活！我们明天要接受检查，我希望这个地方一尘不染!

10: ﻿BUT...

10: 但是……

0: ﻿HAVE A HEART, UNCLE SCROOGE! DAISY WILL KILL ME IF I'M LATE!

0: 求您了，史高治叔叔！如果我迟到了，黛丝会讨厌死我的！

1: ﻿I KNOW! SNORT! I'M COUNTING ON YOUR FEAR OF HER TO SPEED UP YOUR WORK!

1: ﻿我知道！哼！我希望你为了不迟到，能更快地完成工作！

2: ﻿GRUMBLE!

2: 哼！

3: ﻿BUT SCROOGE IS RIGHT,

3: 史高治是对的，

4: ﻿... DONALD WORKS FASTER

4: 唐纳德的工作效率出奇的高

5: ﻿.... THAN HE'S EVER WORKED BEFORE.

5: 他从来没有这么高的效率。

6: ﻿FINISHED! AND ONLY TEN MINUTES BEHIND SCHEDULE! I'VE GOT PLENTY OF TIME TO GET CLEANED UP BEFORE I PICK UP DAISY!

6: ﻿完成了！而且只比原定计划晚了十分钟！在接黛丝之前，我有足够的时间去梳洗一下！

7: DON'T RUSH OFF JUST YET, NEPHEW! I WANT YOU TO TAKE THAT TRUCKLOAD OF TRASH TO THE CITY DUMP!

7: 别急着走，侄子！我还要你把那卡车垃圾运到城市垃圾场！

8: ﻿BUT,

8: 然而……

9: ﻿WHAT? BUT THERE MUST BE HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF - DETERGENT IN IT!?

9: ﻿什么？但我估计里面有至少价值数百美元的清洁剂！？

10: ﻿BAH! I CAN'T SELL IT! SOME NAMBY-PAMBY ENVIRONMENTALISTS HAVE COMPLAINED THAT IT PRODUCES WAY TOO MUCH - SUDS!

10: 我卖不掉它！一些矫情的环保主义者投诉说它会产生太多泡沫!

5

0: ﻿TOUGH, BUT IT CAN WAIT UNTIL TOMORROW! I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO TO THE DUMP TONIGHT!

0: 可以等到明天再运走！我今晚可没时间去垃圾场！

1: ﻿IT CAN'T WAIT! IF THE EPA FINDS IT HERE, THEY'LL SLAP ME WITH A WHOPPING BIG FINE!

1: 需要马上运走！如果环保局发现了，他们会给我开一大笔罚款！

2: ﻿AND THAT WOULD PLAY HAVOC WITH MY PUBLIC RELATIONS CAMPAIGN! 

2: ﻿这会对我的公共关系造成严重的负面影响！

5: ﻿告诉你吧！我会把卡车开到你家，把它藏在凉亭后面！

6: ﻿NO! YOU'LL TAKE IT TO THE DUMP! AND THAT'S FINAL:

6: ﻿不！你要把它运到垃圾场去！就这样！

7: ﻿OK, OK, YOU OLD FOSSIL! BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO PAY FOR MY SPEEDING TICKETS!

7: ﻿好吧，好吧，你这个老顽固！但你得为我的超速罚单买单！

8: ﻿NO SUCH LUCK...

8: ﻿没有这样的运气……

9: ﻿GROAN! THIS RUSH HOUR TRAFFIC IS MURDER: I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GET OUT OF SECOND GEAR!

9: 天哪！这高峰时段的交通简直糟透了！我连三挡都没挂过！

10: ﻿AND LOOK AT THAT LINE OF TRUCKS AHEAD OF ME! LOOKS LIKE EVERY GARBAGE TRUCK IN THE STATE IS HERE FOR A  CONVENTION!

10: 看看我前面的车龙！好像全州的垃圾运输车都聚到这里了。

11: ﻿CITY DUMP

11: 垃圾场

12: ﻿IT WOULD TAKE HOURS TO REACH THE HEAD OF THAT LINE! I'LL JUST PARK THE TRUCK AT MY HOUSE AND COME BACK IN THE MORNING!

12: 轮到我起码还需要几个小时！我还是把卡车停在我家，明早再回来！

2: 帮帮我吧，史密斯！我得尽快处理好这辆卡车！

3: ﻿YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MISERABLE DAISY WILL MAKE MY LIFE IF I STAND HER UP TONIGHT! SHE'S NOT EXACTLY THE SILENT TYPE!

3: 你不知道如果我今晚放她鸽子，黛丝会怎么对我！她可是个母老虎！

4: ﻿YEAH! I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN! MY WIFE IS A CHAMPIONSHIP NAGGER!

4: 我理解你！我的老婆就特别烦人。

5: ﻿ALL RIGHT! YOU CAN PARK HER ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT WALL, RIGHT BY THE RIVER! IF WE'RE LUCKY THE BOSS WILL NEVER GET WISE!
